Miscolor is easy to learn but hard to master. This is your chance to race against the clock, fight your instincts, improve your mental agility, and kill time!

<!--more-->

Choose the color of the word that appears on the screen, not the word itself. You earn 1 point if you're correct and lose 0.5 points if you're wrong.

You have 15 seconds. Every time you choose 5 in a row correctly, you get 5 extra seconds!

Used Swift with XCode.
