I'm currently a senior at MIT studying 6-3 (computer science) and 18 (math). Some of the areas I'm especially interested in are data infrastructure and analytics.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, watching movies, reading, spending time with family and friends, traveling, and playing squash. I'm from Redmond, WA.
